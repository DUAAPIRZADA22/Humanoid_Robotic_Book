# Test Example for Book Content Writer

## Test Input

```
/book-content-writer
Chapter: Introduction to Humanoid Robot Kinematics
Target Audience: Beginners with basic programming knowledge
Outline:
1. Understanding joint coordinates and reference frames
2. Forward kinematics: From joint angles to positions
3. Inverse kinematics: From desired positions to joint angles
4. Practical implementation using Python

Requirements:
- Include code example for forward kinematics calculation
- Add a 'tip' about numerical stability issues
- Include a 'warning' about singularities
```

## Expected Output Structure

The agent should produce a complete Markdown file with:
1. Proper frontmatter with title, description, sidebar_label
2. Engaging introduction
3. Progressive complexity sections
4. Working Python code example with full comments
5. Docusaurus admonitions (tip and warning)
6. Clear transitions between topics
7. Summary and next steps

## Key Points to Validate

- No forbidden buzzwords used
- Professional minimalist tone
- Code is complete and runnable
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Admonitions used appropriately
- Technical accuracy in kinematics explanations
