## Heading Hierarchy

### Heading Level 3

This is a standard paragraph following an H3 heading. Notice the proper spacing and visual hierarchy.

#### Heading Level 4

Subheadings help organize content into logical sections with appropriate visual weight.

##### Heading Level 5

Even deeper levels of organization maintain clarity and readability.

###### Heading Level 6

The smallest heading level, useful for fine-grained content organization.

## Regular Lists

### Unordered List

- Headings scale down on mobile devices
- Tables become horizontally scrollable on small screens
- Text size adjusts for optimal readability
- Spacing is optimized for touch interactions
