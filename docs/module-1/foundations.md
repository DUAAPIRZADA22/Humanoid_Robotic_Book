# Module 1: Foundations

Welcome to the foundational module of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This module introduces you to the core concepts that bridge artificial intelligence with physical robotics.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:

- The fundamental differences between digital AI and Physical AI
- Key challenges in implementing AI in physical systems
- Basic components of humanoid robots
- Introduction to control systems and feedback loops
- Mathematical foundations for robot kinematics

## Core Concepts

### What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that:
- Interact directly with the physical world
- Have bodies or physical manifestations
- Must deal with real-world constraints (physics, energy, safety)
- Operate in real-time with sensory feedback

### The Embodiment Challenge

Unlike purely digital AI, Physical AI systems must:
- **Perceive** their environment through sensors
- **Process** information in real-time
- **Act** on the world through motors and actuators
- **Adapt** to changing conditions and uncertainties

## Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to Embodied Intelligence**
   - Definition and importance
   - Historical context
   - Current state of the art

2. **Robot Kinematics**
   - Forward kinematics
   - Inverse kinematics
   - Jacobian matrices

3. **Sensors and Perception**
   - Vision systems
   - Proprioceptive sensors
   - External sensors

4. **Actuation and Control**
   - Electric motors and servos
   - Hydraulic systems
   - Soft robotics actuators

5. **Safety and Ethics**
   - Physical safety protocols
   - Human-robot interaction
   - Ethical considerations

## Hands-on Exercises

Throughout this module, you'll work with:
- Simulation environments for testing
- Simple robot control algorithms
- Computer vision tasks
- Kinematic calculations

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you'll be ready to explore [Module 2: Perception](../module-2/perception.md), where we dive deeper into how robots see and understand their environment.
