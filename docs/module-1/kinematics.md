# Robot Kinematics

Kinematics is the study of motion without considering forces. In robotics, it describes how robot links and joints move to achieve desired positions.

## Types of Kinematics

### Forward Kinematics
Given joint angles, calculate the end-effector position.

### Inverse Kinematics
Given desired end-effector position, calculate required joint angles.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Transformation Matrices
- 4x4 matrices representing position and orientation
- Composition of rotations and translations

### Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters
Standard method for describing robot arm geometry.

## Coming Soon

This chapter is currently being developed with detailed examples and exercises.
